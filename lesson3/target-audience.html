        <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
        <p>The target audience for this website is people living in the area of Preston, Idaho and its neighboring towns. Those who are expected to go to this 
            website most frequently would be people very engaged in town events and news. I think of mothers wanting to take their children places and to be a part
            of the community. Not only that, the general Preston area population who simply wish to see the weather in the area are in mind, as well.
        </p>
